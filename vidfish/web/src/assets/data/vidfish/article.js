                des:`Released in 2016, this urban romance film directed by Zhang Yibai and starred by male veteran actors, Deng Chao and Zhang Tianai, Yang Yang and Bai Baihe (also in Go Away Mr. Tumour) centers around the themes of terminal illness, loss, friendship and family. The three brothers, Chen Mo, Mao Shiba and Zhu Tou, are all daring and unrelenting in their own interpretations to “a life led well”. While it may seemed foolish, their life paths led them to face unpredictable and unavoidable crossroads.

In the talk show, he speaks of chicken soup for the soul stories to the lonely souls in the city, but in his reality, he wastes himself away. Chen Mo is often at loggerheads with fellow colleague, the talented DJ Xiaorong, although nobody really knows why. One day, DJ Xiaorong announces their breakup on air accidentally, much to everyone’s shock. Later, Chen Mo meets Yao Ji (starring Zhang Tian Ai), a ditzy and interesting girl who is much younger than Chen, and he becomes smitten by her. Well, at this stage, would you be intrigued enough to watch it this film?

Yao Ji on the other hand, thought that Chen Mo’s sad outlook on life, was caused by her, and tries her hardest to fix the problems in their relationship.

However, after watching the movie, I could understand better the director’s intentions of casting Joe Chen and Zhang Han - this film required a more mature cast that could handle the weighted guilt of lost teenage love, carrying it through to young adulthood.

                des:`The main line of the career line of "Gank Your Heart" is actually very clear. It is the men’s quarter-to-space. After various sets of frustrations and failures in the veteran team legend and VNG, they formed a team and boarded it. The story of the top of the world. During this period, in three events, the TV series was very exciting. First, because of the hand speed problem of the old captain Gu Fang, the legend lost to Tata in the global finals, and the season vacated the nickname of "hands disabled." Second, because of the leak, Qi Xiang was deprived of the qualification for the battle. VNG was defeated in the domestic autumn competition, and Ji Xiangkong once again became an excuse for the team to lose. Third, the newly formed Phoenix team won the championship in the global finals and defeated Tata. Ji Xiangkong finally proved his ability and fulfilled his commitment to Gufang. These three events, one after another, the complexity of the behind-the-scenes story, the excitement of the commentary, the operation and interpretation of the players, can be said to be the essence of the film and the finishing touch, so that they do not understand e-sports at all. People are all too addicted and patriotic complexes burst.

                But compared to the competition, I prefer to participate in everyone, the Phoenix team. Ji Xiangkong said that he wanted to form a perfect team. So he found Sun Zhiyi, an ancient god hidden in Internet cafes, and found the first Zhongdan Xixi, and found his best brother, Lin Yixuan, and found half of it. In the first month, he entered the top four of the national costume, Xiuling. It’s a coincidence that these five people have been carrying a period of past and are carrying the ridicule and doubt of the world.
                    
                The season is empty, the battlefield "fraudster" can quickly analyze the situation according to the situation on the field, and formulate the most practical tactics, but because it is not the top hand speed and tactical needs, the regular back pot becomes the so-called "tumor" of the sport".
                    
                As a "one brother", Sun Zeyi was forgotten by the world. Even the group photo does not have a name. When he came out again, Li dare said "to admire his courage". The words are actually not admiration, but full of mockery, you See you retired for five years, you see that you are all thirty years old, you still want to compete for the championship among a group of 17-year-old children! Is it a bit idiotic to say a dream? !
                
                Besides, Xi Xi, personal ability is outstanding, solo no one can rival, but Yu Feng is a team sport after all, a person can not be a strong five-player, he needs to prove not his ability, but his collaboration and team awareness.
                
                Lin Yixuan, the strongest assistant, but after leaving the season to the air seems to be in a hurry, does not seem to feel the initial touch and sense of accomplishment brought by the competition.
                
                What about Xialing? Originally dreamed of being the king on the basketball court, but because of a car accident, one leg was injured and could no longer play, but saw a light in the world of e-sports.
                
                But it happened that these four people, plus the seasons, can't be perfect anymore. Sun Zeyi represents the mature and rich experience of the competition, Yu Xi represents the integration of outstanding personal skills and team consciousness, Lin Yixuan represents absolute trust and obedience, Xia Ling represents the young momentum and infinite possibilities, while Ji Xiankong himself It represents the brain and the command. It can be said that these five people have their own advantages and disadvantages, but they complement each other and are indispensable. Therefore, the combination of the five people finally made the phoenix's summit myth.
                
                They are friends, family members, and finally teammates. And what is more exciting than this? ! For this kind of story that only happens in comics or adolescence, they are performing, not counting fame and fortune, not counting gains and losses, or even paying, but just want to fight with you and you!
                
                Even if they are questioned in many ways, they still embrace the future with courage!

                des:`In fact, "Gank Your Heart" is essentially an idol drama, an idol drama dominated by love and esports. The idol drama is good or bad, and the relationship between men and women is very important. But, yes, I want to say "but", this drama, between men and women, there is no feeling at all. Wang Yibo played the season to the air, the early stage of playing handsome cool is definitely better than the later love, especially the few scenes he touched the hair of the woman, a little bit embarrassing. But overall, the degree of completion is acceptable, not too much.
                
                The prince, the prince, had seen her "Flower Blossoms" before, and it was quite good to Yangyang, and it was beautiful and funny with Huang Shengchi. But looking at the drama, we can only say that people set up and acting all the way down. Qiu Ying has a few scenes that look at the season to the sky. It’s really a shame. Don’t say that there is a star in the eye, and there is no love in the eyes.
                
                There are still a few misunderstandings that I thought would become a burst point. It’s really hard to say. First, Qiu Ying took the season to the sky and the background to see Mi Ya, seeing the man and the woman two together, not to mention, turn around and run, do not listen to the explanation of the man, regardless of heavy rain, even the turbulent traffic , all the way to run. Ok, if you don't listen, don't listen. Why do you call me every other day, and you will listen to the second story between her and the man. Say good trust? Qiu Ying’s trust in Ji Xiangkong, don’t say that Lin Yixuan is even worse than Yu Xi and Shu Wen.
                
                Then the drama came to the end. At the crucial moment of the Phoenix Impact Champion, Qiu Ying once again saw that the man and the woman were holding together, and they did not ask the reason, did not listen to the explanation, and did not say anything, turned around and ran. Have you ever thought about what kind of influence your behavior will bring to the man, and he has a decisive game to fight! I can only say that in the end, the Phoenix can win. It is completely a scriptwriter who has stuffed a bit of dog food and a bowl of dog blood into the audience's mouth. It really makes the originally exciting and full-fledged story instantly dull and boring.
                
                Compared with Ji Xiangkong and Qiu Ying, I really like Lu Yiyi and Lin Yixuan, Shu Wen and Sun Zeyi. A pair of funny but not lacking affection, a pair of affection is embarrassing. In particular, Shu Wen and Sun Zeyi have not written much, and even have few opponents, but they are pulling the audience, want to understand them, and want to know everything that happened five years ago. It can be said that Shu Wen is really my favorite female character in this drama. It is beautiful and embarrassing. Five years ago, I won the game and hooked up Sun Zeyi’s sigh of "When you are my boyfriend" and all the truth after five years. Dabai asked Sun Zeyi, "Do you still love me?" The deep affection, the performance is really very good, so that the viewer is moving.
                
                As the only drama I have watched recently, I am really a call for "Gank Your Heart", not perfect, but it is worth seeing!

In their complicated feelings, Hua Zheng is in love with Guo Jing, and Guo Jing only has a good impression on Hua Zheng. Guo Jing really loves people. Huang Rong, Guo Jing called Huang Rongrong, Huang Rong called Guo Jingjing brother, Guo Jing is very honest and honest, and often deceived, but still got the heart of Huang Rong, so, everyone has a place that others like, everyone is Unique. I still remember that Huang Rong had three quasi-three inaccuracies: "Jing brother, I have three quasi-three, you must promise me. First, after I die, I will allow you to marry another one, but that person must be Huazheng; Second, I will allow you to make a grave for me, but I am not allowed to bring you a kite to see me, because I am still a stingy; third, after I am dead, I will allow you to be sad for me for a while, but I am not allowed to be depressed for my will." Visible, at that time, their feelings are also very beautiful.
                
                There are many more, such as the feelings of Yang Kang and Mu Nianci, the feelings of Wan Yanhong, the weak feelings, the feelings of Zhou Botong on his wife and the struggle between the major gangs. In short, this TV series adapted from Mr. Jin Yong’s novels. It's really classic and it's worth watching for everyone. This martial arts novel is very popular with me. So far the influence is very high.

After that, the same type of dramas will appear beyond the drama. It is not difficult to get a meal.

And when I got up and walked out the door, when I saw the languid faces exposed to the sun, I still had to face the people I hated. This is no way. Unless you are a madman, you can do everything you want, including killing. You can't change the world, so you can only find ways to change yourself.

Hope, hey, sinking, can't extricate himself, go crazy, in the end, but a gorgeous illusion, self-deception, self-directed, drunken dreams... wake up to find everything is boring, no different from anyone, but Err.

                However, some people still believe that "fate" is such a magical thing that can't be pondered like a crystal ball in the hands of a witch. Like the mysteries of the universe, alien creatures, the Bermuda Triangle, the Loch Ness Monster, the black hole of time... all you have only heard of, but have not seen the things you have personally touched. I want to know how many people believe that there must be something called "destined" or "soul mate" in this world. For some people, it is a myth, a legend, a story, a fabrication, or an urban legend, a god that everyone is eager to change. Just like a lottery ticket, it is like picking up a suitcase with a million cash lost by someone else. In short, it is a symbol of the exhaustion of character and the thunder of heaven. It is a lot of life empty, hopelessly hope that one day, the mediocre woman who flies into the branches, or the innocent young masters who are in the comfort of life and who are suffering from the hardships will pursue hard. Whoever let the age of the sinus begin to open, the Qiu Yao Auntie as the originator of a singularity of the snow and the moon has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, so the romance of men and women are expected to encounter in various ways on the street, encounter in Lijiang, encountered in the elevator, in The office is passionate, playing in the air on the radio, and coming to Titanic on board.
                
                However, ordinary as we, why do you want to miracle? How can women accept life and the movie in the movie is always different, when will it be willing to believe that that person and you are just two of the thousands of ordinary cells in the earth creature, you end up However, it is because of a piece of paper that involves each other and accompany each other to continue the species. In fact, there are actually two individuals who are plain and faint. Why do you want to love the sky and thunder, why do you want to be hit by the sharp arrow of Cupid, you have to pick it up, psychedelic, you have to be addicted, you have to feel the earth, crying and crying . That kills movies and novels! Women never feel satisfied because reality is always too different from what is described in the novel. Reality can't always be as good as a movie. The joy is to rejoice at home, and the sadness is to die. The truth is, the person you marry at the end is better to sit with you and enjoy the drama without falling asleep.
                
                These stories affect the hormone secretion of women, so I believe that there are signs in life, there are hints. Yes, in fact, this is completely understandable. Because the story is always too good, it is what most humanity can't resist. Who will not love and craving for good things, who do not want to escape from the cold life to the warm embrace. Even if it is false, it is a mirage, such a wind and snow is simply incorrigible, but if there is such a possibility, do you still want to?
                
                So there are some women like this. There may be someone around them, but they always feel that something is wrong. Even if she thinks they love each other, she plans to marry him and keep him forever. Even if she thinks he is all good, even if he is willing to give her the ring that the mother passed down. However, there is a small corner in her heart, a hidden place, a place that is so airtight, and always has a small question mark from time to time. This question mark afflicts her shape and is unable to fall asleep. Finally one day there was a voice and scared her. Then she was confused and had no idea. She began to be full of missions. She felt that this was the arrangement of fate. I felt that there was something I had to do and I had to do it. She began to suspect that the person around her was not the one that was destined. There is another person, the owner of the real rib, who is still on the way. If she does not rush, he will be stuck and killed. OMG! So the woman is crazy, so the surreal love has happened. WELL, the story begins like this. At the end of the story, like Cinderella and other common fairy tale endings: the hands of the prince and the princess were brought together and they began their happy life. As for what life is like, please be obsessed with yourself.
                
                Love is really the most magical psychological suggestion. As far as the eyes are concerned, the four eyes are opposite, and it has been determined that the other party is not the forefront of this life. But it doesn't matter, it's actually not very important. I once heard a story saying that two mice saw a bat flying through the sky, so one of them said to the other: Dear, look, angel!
                
                Yes, what matters is not what it is. What matters is what is in our hearts. The true value of things is in everyone's heart. Just like the line in the film: "When you are attracted to someone, it just means that you are attracted to each other subconsciously. Therefore, the so-called fate is just two madmen who think they are a god-made couple. Set a pair."
                
                It’s too simple to think about it in fact, but it’s just two people who believe in it. And can you meet the "you believe that he also believes, you are crazy, he is crazy, you jump and he jumps" is the key issue.

The earlier "Little Age" scores are so low that there are countless Paying for people, today's "The Summer Solstice is not yet" is also the memory of many people's youth, not because of how good it is written and how close to reality. On the contrary, the gorgeous rhetoric in the text seems to be non-mainstream, but in the teens At the age of us, we are all "the youngsters don't know what to eat, and they want to give new words to say good things." At that time, we all felt that "youth is a bright sorrow." We also like to "look up at the 45-degree angle and look up at the sky, in order not to Let the tears flow down." A friend told me that "The Summer Solstice is not yet" is the first novel she saw. Some friends told me that "The Summer Solstice is not yet" is the existence of her entire youth, and my "Summer solstice is not yet", only halfway through the corner of the bookcase, let the dust fill, that is Guo Jingming The favorite book in the book is full of youthful taste, green and delicate, delicate and gentle, until someone tells me the ending.

                But after all, the story is in the cliché, the brothers who love the same brothers and sisters like a girl at the same time, the intimate girlfriends fall in love with the same boy, the girlfriends sleep with the boyfriend of the woman and the children with their children let the male and female protagonists break up, like the male master Miss Qingmei Zhuma Qianjin made a secret, and the man who loved the woman’s lord was silently guarded. The female hostess’s betrayal of the female lord was completely blackened, and it was simply called the bloody idol drama collection. Does it mean that there is no unforgettable and heartbreaking youth that can only be said to have been eaten by dogs? In this way, the youth of most people is really eaten by dogs!

                This is a very interesting and comfortable online drama. 24 episodes, updated in three weeks, very refreshing. (Compared to the next door, "Boss", too conscience!)
                The background of the story is old-fashioned, but the storyline is unconventional.
                The background of the story is a girl who listens to her mother's words from a young age. She wants to pursue her own voice-over ideal and promises to record a love program in order to study in Japan. The male master is a powerful violin maker, and joined the recording of the show by chance. The two had a meeting because of the intersection of the programs, and they slowly got to know each other and eventually got together. The height difference of 30 cm is really cute~

                In the development of the plot, compared to the original, the rhythm of the TV series is much slower, Ye Haowei and Beibei ears, Ye Weiwei is cold, and the ears are not well expressed. The setting of these two personality is cold color, two streams Calm and flowing. After reading the last episode, I still think that Ye Shuwei is Ye Weiwei, the shell ear is the shell ear, and the plainness is faint.
                
                What needs to be praised is that compared to the original film, the film is together. I think that the second season of the reality show of the drama will start to take a large-scale pink bubble in line with the character's setting. But there are also a lot of sweet scenes missing.
                
                The misunderstanding at the beginning, after mutual cohabitation, is also mutual respect. The beginning of the embarrassment, the embarrassment is also very real, but picking up the family and waiting for a series of small moves or watching the aunt laugh.
                Ye Haowei was in front of the whole process, and it was in line with his self-discipline. The back of the Bayer’s ear slowly liked it, and it was revealed from a smile.

It is very suitable for the ears, ideals and love. It is difficult to decide. Not eager to prove your love, seeing the heart is the most important. Special praise, the props group, the broken earphone screen, this is the mobile phone for poor students! !
                
                The relationship between Tang Li and Yu Sheng, the embarrassment between the offices, the overbearing president did not desperate for Cinderella, the warm heart of the move, may be cultivation is not love. I like Tang Li's crisp and neat, decent departure. Just spit it out, why do you want to find the nuts in the sugar-fried chestnuts!
