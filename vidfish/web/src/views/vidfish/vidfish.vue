                                At the beginning of this movie, I still had a thought on the film about the theme of youth. Because there are too many regrets, I have so many thoughts. And the person we have been obsessed with in the past is not as amazing as it was when we first saw it. The reason why we are nostalgic is because the heart is not good. The film starred by Chen Qiaoen and Zhang Han. To be honest, I was more resistant to seeing such an actor lineup. After all, the 30-year-olds who appeared in the youthful young boys and girls are still quite guilty. But after reading it, I think maybe they can show the regret of the lack of love after the years.

                                After spending a week, I finally chased after "I will accompany you to the world" and I feel a lot of emotions. I am not an e-sports fan, I don’t even know anything about this sport. The closest connection is that I have read the original novel "E-sports lovers" of "To accompany you to the world" and read the "Second Room" of Erbao. "Sleepy fish", "Honey stew stewed squid", "God's left hand", I have seen the ear rabbit's "I have heard you in time"... These novels let me know the world of e-sports, and full Feel the unique charm of this sport. What I want to say is that the TV series accompanying you to the world as the first e-sports theme on the TV screen may still be a little lacking, but I still think this is a good-looking film.

However, when I saw the official pilot video, I decided to go to the show - the actors were very fond of the show. As for the overall quality of the show, at least a few episodes have to be seen to judge (yes, that is, to give no brains, don't know if there is no brain to understand).

This is a subversion of my fixed image of the vampire slutty, it is the cute girl.

And when I got up and walked out the door, when I saw the languid faces exposed to the sun, I still had to face the people I hated. This is no way. Unless you are a madman, you can do everything you want, including killing. You can't change the world, so you can only find ways to change yourself.

You just lived as good as everyone else and accepted everything. Only.

I have to say that Guo Jingming is really affecting the youth of a generation. The earlier "Little Age" scores are so low that there are countless Paying for people, today's "The Summer Solstice is not yet" is also the memory of many people's youth, not because of how good it is written and how close to reality. On the contrary, the gorgeous rhetoric in the text seems to be non-mainstream, but in the teens At the age of us, we are all "the youngsters don't know what to eat, and they want to give new words to say good things." At that time, we all felt that "youth is a bright sorrow." We also like to "look up at the 45-degree angle and look up at the sky, in order not to Let the tears flow down." A friend told me that "The Summer Solstice is not yet" is the first novel she saw. Some friends told me that "The Summer Solstice is not yet" is the existence of her entire youth, and my "Summer solstice is not yet", only halfway through the corner of the bookcase, let the dust fill, that is Guo Jingming The favorite book in the book is full of youthful taste, green and delicate, delicate and gentle, until someone tells me the ending.

                                This is a very interesting and comfortable online drama. 24 episodes, updated in three weeks, very refreshing. (Compared to the next door, "Boss", too conscience!)
                                The background of the story is old-fashioned, but the storyline is unconventional.
                                The background of the story is a girl who listens to her mother's words from a young age. She wants to pursue her own voice-over ideal and promises to record a love program in order to study in Japan. The male master is a powerful violin maker, and joined the recording of the show by chance. The two had a meeting because of the intersection of the programs, and they slowly got to know each other and eventually got together. The height difference of 30 cm is really cute~
